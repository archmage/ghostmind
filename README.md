# ghostmind

ghostmind is an [Urban Dead](http://urbandead.com/) client with an emphasis on providing long-term tactical information and eliminating monotony. It was borne from a desire to play Urban Dead with a more modern user experience, that could be augmented in ways that would acommodate the needs of the playerbase.

# Status
