# ghostmind

ghostmind is an [urbandead](http://urbandead.com/) client with an emphasis on providing long-term tactical information and eliminating monotony.

the streets of malton are quite old now. the remnants of its former glory still linger, like ghosts who roam empty lands in search of purpose.

this project is my gift to those ghosts.
